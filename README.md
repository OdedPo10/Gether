## Summary



React Native is a powerful framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications, and it was the primary technology used to build the front-end of the app. MongoDB was chosen as the database of choice due to its flexibility and scalability. NodeJS was used to create a server-side API, which enables the app to interact with the database and provide real-time location tracking capabilities. Socket.io is a powerful library that enables real-time communication between the server and the client, which was essential for the real-time tracking feature of the app. Finally, Expo was used to simplify the development and deployment of the app.

The Google Maps API was used to provide accurate location tracking and map visualization in the app. It enables users to view their current location and search for nearby places of interest, such as restaurants.

The TripAdvisor API was used as a source of restaurants for the app. It provides a vast database of restaurants and their information, such as ratings, reviews, and photos. This enables users to find the best restaurants in their location easily.
